wizard|assets/tutorial/board_step_01.png|Welcome, traveler. This is Quoridor: a game of calm thinking and clever blocking.
knight|assets/tutorial/board_step_01.png|I win by reaching the other side first... but walls can change everything.

wizard|assets/tutorial/board_step_02.png|Your mission is simple: reach the opposite edge of the board.
knight|assets/tutorial/board_step_02.png|First pawn to touch the enemy home row wins.

wizard|assets/tutorial/board_step_03.png|On your turn, you choose one action.
knight|assets/tutorial/board_step_03.png|Move your pawn... or place a wall. Not both.

wizard|assets/tutorial/board_step_04.png|A normal move is one square: up, down, left, or right.
knight|assets/tutorial/board_step_04.png|No diagonals. Move 1 tile (orthogonal only) You cannot cross walls.\nClick your pawn, then click a highlighted adjacent square.

wizard|assets/tutorial/board_step_05.png|If the opponent is directly next to you, you may jump over them.
knight|assets/tutorial/board_step_05.png|But only if no wall blocks the jump.

wizard|assets/tutorial/board_step_06.png|Walls do not sit inside squares. They sit between squares.
knight|assets/tutorial/board_step_06.png|A wall blocks movement through two edges at once.

wizard|assets/tutorial/board_step_07.png|Walls must be fair. You may slow your rival, but never trap them completely.
knight|assets/tutorial/board_step_07.png|Every player must always have at least one path to their goal.

wizard|assets/tutorial/board_step_08.png|The game ends the moment a pawn reaches its target row.
knight|assets/tutorial/board_step_08.png|No extra turns. No final wall. Just victory.

wizard|assets/tutorial/board_step_09.png|Two plans exist: go faster, or slow the other.
knight|assets/tutorial/board_step_09.png|The trick is choosing the right one at the right time.

wizard|assets/tutorial/board_step_10.png|Let us summarize in one glance.
knight|assets/tutorial/board_step_10.png|Then you are ready to play.
